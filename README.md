K-Means Clustering Project

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to different datasets, including structured and spiral-shaped data.

Files  
- `kmeans_clustering.py`: Clusters points from `s1.txt`, `s2.txt`, `s3.txt`, and `s4.txt` using K-Means.  
- `spiral_kmeans.py`: Clusters points from `spiral.txt` assuming three clusters.  

How to Run  
1. Install dependencies:  
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
